Simple text editors: You may use any text editor in the VM (vi, emacs, nano and nedit are available in the VM) to edit text files. Instead, you may use your favorite text editor from your host OS (e.g., notepad or TextEdit) and transfer the edited file to the VM through the shared directory. Remember that the directory that you specified as the shared directory from the host (e.g., C:\vm-shared from Windows) is available at /mnt/hgfs/host_shared in the VM, which is symbolically linked at $HOME/shared as well. Again, be careful with the CR/LF issue if you use the second option.
