As we explained in the MySQL tutorial, we have created two databases in MySQL on our VM: TEST and CS144 (note these database names are case sensitive). The CS144 database is your "production" database, meant for use in the final versions of your code. The TEST database is for any experimentation and for use during development and debugging. We have created two MySQL users for the database. For your project work, use the MySQL user cs144 (no password), which has full access to the CS144 and TEST databases. The MySQL user root with password password has full unrestricted access to everything and should be used only for special adminstrative operations, like creating new users and databases, etc.
